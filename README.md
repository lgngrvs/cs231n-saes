# Welcome!
This is a github repo I made to archive current progress on my CS231N project (as of mid-may 2025). 

- The PDF is our project milestone (containing preliminary results, basically just "evidence that we have a working SAE training loop, even if our SAE currently sucks because we only trained it on 12.5% of the CIFAR-10 dataset lol")

- The jupyter file is a copy of our code, which shows the working SAE training loop for a simple linear SAE, trained with l1 reg and MSE loss. We implemented the hooks, architecture, etc. ourselves instead of using SAElens for the learning value, as well as just because we were not sure that SAELens could cover all the experiments we wanted to run.
